Blurring** would make the details in the clothing and hat appear soft or out of focus.\n- **C. Low clarity** would result in a lack of sharpness and detail in the clothing and hat.\n- **D. Blocking artifacts** would cause visible block-like distortions, often seen in compressed images.\n\nIf the distortion is described as affecting the clothing and hat specifically, **B.
